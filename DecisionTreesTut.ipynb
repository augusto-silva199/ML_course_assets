        "\n",
        "This exercise serves as a fundamental template for understanding how Machine Learning translates into Clinical Decision Support. While we have used the Wisconsin Breast Cancer dataset to build our \"Engine,\" the logic applies to almost any diagnostic pathway in radiology and medicine.\n",
        "\n",
        "🧬 Summary of our Findings\n",
        "* Algorithmic Transparency: We moved from a \"Black Box\" to a visible flowchart. The Decision Tree mimics the \"If-Then\" logic used by clinicians during differential diagnosis.\n",
        "\n",
        "* The Power of Simplicity: We saw that a well-behaved dataset allows a simple classifier to achieve high accuracy without needing complex neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Quality Control through Pruning: We demonstrated that \"more depth\" isn't always better. Restricting the tree (Pruning) ensures the model learns stable clinical patterns rather than memorizing individual patient \"noise.\"\n",
        "\n",
        "🏛️ Why this Dataset is the \"Perfect Lab\"\n",
        "It is important to note that this specific exercise used a \"Well-Behaved\" dataset, which is rare in real-world clinical practice:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Class Balance: The split between Benign and Malignant cases was relatively even (~60/40). In real screening environments, the \"Disease\" class might be less than 1%, requiring much more advanced \"Class Weighting\" techniques.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Data Integrity: There were no missing values. In a typical hospital database, you would encounter missing labels, corrupted images, or incomplete patient histories that require significant \"Data Cleaning\" before a tree can be grown.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Linear Separability: Many features in this dataset (like concave_points) have a very clear \"Threshold\" that separates the classes, which is why our ROC curve showed such a strong \"Knee\" early on.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Feature Importance is specific to this dataset — in a different patient population, the most important \"predictor\" might change.\n",
